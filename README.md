# Modeling Video as Stochastic Processes for Fine-Grained Video Representation Learning
Video as Stochastic Processes (VSP), a novel process-based contrastive learning framework for fine-grained video pepresentation Learning, which aims to discriminate between video processes and simultaneously capture the temporal dynamics in the processes. Specifically, we enforce the embeddings of the frame sequence of interest to approximate a goal-oriented stochastic process, i.e., Brownian bridge, in the latent space via a process-based contrastive loss.
